[![GitHub Release][releases-shield]][releases]
[![License][license-shield]](LICENSE)

A custom component based on [rikroe/eurotronic-cometblue](https://github.com/rikroe/eurotronic-cometblue) to support Eurotronic's CometBlue thermostats (and similar).

We support the same devices as our upstream library:
- Eurotronic Comet Blue
- Sygonix HT100 BT
- Xavax Hama
- Lidl Silvercrest RT2000BT

This component aims to support as many of the TRV functions as possible, adding more step by step.

**This integration will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`climate` | Climate entity with **target temperature**, **target temperature range** and **preset mode** support.<br />Supported preset modes: `none` (manual mode), `eco` (low temperature), `away` (not implemented yet), `comfort` (high temperature)
`number` | Number entities to adjust additional TRV settings: **offset**, **target temperature low**, **target temperature high**, **window open time in minutes**
`sensor` | Sensor entities for TRV state: **battery**
`service` | Services to interact with schedules and dates: **set_datetime**, **get_schedule**, **set_schedule**
